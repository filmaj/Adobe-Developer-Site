# Welcome to the Adobe Developer Site project!

We're rebuilding the `adobe.io` site, and eventually moving to `https://developers.adobe.com`. Based on our research, we want to prioritize the following for ***developers*** that visit the site:

With over 50 internal Adobe stakeholders, we're going to be following a radical approach of collaboration–come build with us!

We want to empower Adobe stakeholders by:
 * [Roadmap](#project-roadmap)–we set the overall goals to support stakeholders based on research
 * [Rituals](#project-rituals)–we maintain a regular cadence of project activities that all internal stakeholders are welcome to join
 * [Agency](#stakeholder-agency)–our goal is to put the power to evolve and publish in the hands of all internal stakeholders

# Project Roadmap

The current https://adobe.io site is nearing the completion of the upgrade path to AEM 6.4. As we build the new site, we'll be running the two in parallel. This hybrid delivery will be seamless to the end users, but extra work internally. We expect to be running in this hybrid mode for the better part of 2019.

During this time, bugs filed against the current AEM site should be [filed here](https://jira.corp.adobe.com/projects/DEVEP/issues/DEVEP-925). Issues against the new codebase, should be [filed here](https://github.com/adobe/Adobe-Developer-Site/issues/new).

We understand this will be confusing. If in doubt, [file issues in jira](https://jira.corp.adobe.com/projects/DEVEP/issues/DEVEP-925) and we'll move them to the correct home during triage.

## [Research Phase I](https://github.com/adobe/Adobe-Developer-Site/milestone/6)

We sythesize and communicate the results of our first research phase.

## [Helix Live[s!]](https://github.com/adobe/Adobe-Developer-Site/milestone/5)

Helix is the next-generation Adobe CMS. In this milestone, we deploy part of https://adobe.io using Helix. To start, we'll be rendering the adobe.io homepage!

## [Contributor-ready Doc Rendering](https://github.com/adobe/Adobe-Developer-Site/milestone/7)

In this milestone, we render some real documentation including a contributor flow so that our community of developers can offer feedback and bug fixes.

## [Product Area Rendering](https://github.com/adobe/Adobe-Developer-Site/milestone/8)

Here we render home pages for the product groups and hand over the keys for changing their content and deploying.

## [IA Refresh](https://github.com/adobe/Adobe-Developer-Site/milestone/9)

We implement the new IA, which impacts top-level navigation and the footer. Current WIP is here:

# Stakeholder Agency

It's our intention for stakeholders to become empowered to meet the needs of their developer customers. We will strive to provide common tooling and systems support in a logical priority based on our research. To put this in plain english, we want stakeholders to be able to modify and publish their content without any consultation or delay!

With over 50 stakeholders, we're not going to be able to build everything for everyone right away. We're following an open governance approach where we can enable you to publish content and systems outside of the current capabilities. We'd even like to help you do this! By appropriately using [Spectrum](https://spectrum.corp.adobe.com/) and implementing the shared IA, we can extend the developer domain to proxy your content and functionality. If you have needs, please [file an issue](https://github.com/adobe/Adobe-Developer-Site/issues) and join the next triage meeting.
